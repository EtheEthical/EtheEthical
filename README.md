# Hi, I'm Ethan!

I'm a Python & Java developer who LOVES astronomy and astrophysics!  I started coding in 2020, when I was just nine years old.  I haven't stopped since.  Most of my projects are related to game development or astronomy.  If you're curious about anything here, [just shoot me an email](mailto:etheethical@gmail.com)!
